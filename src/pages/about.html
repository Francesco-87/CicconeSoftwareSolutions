                <p class="story-lead">
                Founded in 2025 after seeing too many small businesses struggle online, 
                I set out to make professional sites fast, secure, and easy to maintain.

                Ciccone Software Solutions focuses on practical, lightweight stacks—clean HTML/CSS/JS, 
                Vite builds, and static hosting—so clients get speed, security, and low upkeep without 
                the agency price tag.

                    My Story 
                    Why I Started Ciccone Software Solutions 
                    After [brief personal/industry insight], I realized small businesses deserve enterprise-grade technology just as much as large firms.

            My Mission & Values
            I’m driven by accessibility, quality, and future-focus: making powerful software simple, reliable, and future-proof for everyone.

            Who I Am
            I’m Francesco—a full-stack generalist with X years in web and cloud development. I love solving tricky problems, crafting clean code, and seeing small teams punch above their weight.

            Fun Fact
            When I’m not coding, you’ll find me [your hobby/personal detail], which keeps my creative juices flowing.

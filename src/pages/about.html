                <p class="story-lead">
                Founded in 2025 after helping family and friends get online, 
                I saw how confusing domains, email, and hosting can be. 
                My goal is to remove that friction for small businesses—clear guidance, 
                lightweight builds, and automated deploys—so your site stays fast, secure, and easy to maintain.
                </p>

                <p>
                I use lightweight, standards-based tech and static hosting so sites stay fast, secure, 
                and low-maintenance—without the agency price tag.

            <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
             <p>Hi, I’m Francesco, the founder of Ciccone Software Solutions. I’m passionate about leveling the playing field for small businesses through smart, scalable technology.</p>
                    My Story 
                    Why I Started Ciccone Software Solutions 
                    After [brief personal/industry insight], I realized small businesses deserve enterprise-grade technology just as much as large firms.

            My Mission & Values
            I’m driven by accessibility, quality, and future-focus: making powerful software simple, reliable, and future-proof for everyone.

            Who I Am
            I’m Francesco—a full-stack generalist with X years in web and cloud development. I love solving tricky problems, crafting clean code, and seeing small teams punch above their weight.

            Fun Fact
            When I’m not coding, you’ll find me [your hobby/personal detail], which keeps my creative juices flowing.

to use in the about me section. 
Here’s a tighter “About Me”–style snapshot you can use:

Full-stack setup: I register domains, configure DNS, and wire up professional email (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) with Google Workspace.

Secure hosting: I deploy static sites on GitHub Pages, enable HTTPS across root & www, and automate SSL renewals.

Brand & design: I define color palettes, typography, and create custom logos (lettermarks, geometric icons, SVG exports).

Responsive development: I build lightweight, multi-language HTML/CSS/JS portfolios with accessible navigation and contact forms.

Ongoing maintenance: I establish automated checklists (SSL, DNS, dependency alerts) and form-spam defenses to keep sites running smoothly.
